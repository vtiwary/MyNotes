**DDOS**
Designed to overload website/API and compete against legitimate connections
Distributed: Hard to block individual IPs/ranges
3 categories of DDOS attack
 1)Application Layer: HTTP Flood: easy to request a page but takes lot of effort to respond.. this impalence is exploited here
 2) Protocol based attack i.e. SYN Floods--> take advantage of connection based natured of TCP/IP. If they send SYN Flood, 
 server will try to contact the client which isnt there anyway
