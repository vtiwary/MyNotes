There are 7 layers in OSI model
3 media and 4 host layer (physical -1, applicatin - 7th) .. it starts from application layers in source and ends at appliaction layer (i.e. chrome)  in destination, going from later 
7to 1 and then at destination 1 (physical i.e network card layer) to 7 
when talking at a layer x means later x and below.. like later 3 and has layer 1,2,3 capabilities

**Layer 1** Physical layer
physical is 0 and 1 and the agreement between devices on 0 and 1

Hub can be used but the feature here is if anything is received at one post it's transmitted to its all ports, including error and collisions
layer 1 : no device address, all data is processed by all devices
Like: Shouting in a Room full of people wihtut using any name

layer 1 has no media controll access.. no control over who can transmit.. in layer 1 there are just network cards transmitting the information via voltage changes
Doesn't give uniquly identifiable devices

**Layer 2** Data Link layer
All layers above use data link later
