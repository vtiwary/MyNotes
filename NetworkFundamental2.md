NAT (Network Address Translation) 
NAT was created to address shortage of IPV4 addresses .. to private devices gives access and translate it back and gives security as Well

TYpes:
1) Static NAT: 1 private to 1 public
2) Dynamic NAT: Pool of public IPS..large private IP but less public IP
3) PAT (Port address translation) Many private IP to one public (NAT Gateway)
Port to identify individual IPs.. IPv6 NAT doesn't makes sense
